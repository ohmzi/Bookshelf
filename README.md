# BookshelfðŸ“š - AceAge's take home assignment

First of all, welcome, and thank you for choosing to interview at AceAge!

The home assignment is an Android project that we would like you to peer-review and then present your findings in the interview.
We know time is a limited resource, so the assignment was designed to take max 1-2 hours.

Imagine this:
*We are starting a new social media company for readers to track which books they own.
Their social circle will be able to ask to borrow a books.
They will also be able to start virtual books clubs with peers based on the common books they own.*

*This is all the long term goal though, so as the first step we've tasked our junior developer to start on the app.
The requirements were to implement searching for books and to be able to save them to your bookshelf.
There is no account creation required yet, the bookshelf is stored locally.
We're using OpenLibrary's API (https://openlibrary.org/) to search for books because we don't want to maintain our own.*

**Your assignment** is to peer-review the project and offer guidance. Anything in the project is up for discussion.
- You can prepare notes anyway you see fit.
- We are not expecting you to implement the fixes yourself.
- Feel free to come with code samples if needed, but how you present your findings is up to you. Remember, the goal is to offer a peer-review and guidance for a junior developer.

In the interview we will ask you to present your notes and we'll come up with questions for discussion along the way.

Best of luck with the assignment!
Looking forward to meeting you and to our chat.
